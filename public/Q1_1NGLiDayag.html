      This is my first non-graded exercise to practice the use
      of variables and displaying results as pop-up dialog box or
      on the browser on the console.
   </p>
   <script>
        let age=18;
        let maxAge = 100;
        let numPerDay = 2;
        let totalRequired = (numPerDay * 365) * (maxAge - age);  
        document.write("You will need " + totalRequired + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge);
        alert(`Your will need ${totalRequired} to last you until the ripe old age of ${maxAge}`);
        console.log("You will need "+ totalRequired + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge);
   </script>
