WRITE 2 PARAGRAPHS OF REFLECTION
-   The State of the Nation Address or SONA is an annual address made by the current Philippine President. Its purpose is to inform the nation and its people about the country's social, economic, and political state. In this year's SONA by President Marcos Jr., he focused more on practical issues like affordable rice, expanded wifi connection, improved education, etc. This shows that the government is attempting to return the essential needs and regain the public's trust. 

-   The 2025 SONA gave Filipinos a reason to be hopeful, but also a reason to be cautious. Ideas or promises like the 20 pesos per kilo of rice, 100 million coconut trees, lower meat prices, etc. are all ambitious but there is a history of promises that fell short. If the government follows through with their promises and their great ideas then this could indicate a real turning point in the Philippine Government. If not, it is just another well-written speech.

WHAT ONE WORD/ PHRASE/ OR SENTENCE DO YOU HAVE FOR THE PHILIPPINES AFTER HEARING SONA 2025
- Hopefully it's not all talk
